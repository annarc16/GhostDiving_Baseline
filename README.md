# GhostDiving_Baseline
Oceanographic buoys are an increasingly important meteorological and oceanographic information point. Installed at sea in order to measure the parameters we want and provide this information in real time. Thanks to this collection of time series of data, past situations can be analyzed and future predictions made. The Baseline project of the GhostDiving association aims to use these buoys to monitor the movement of sand on the seabed. Which are believed to impede the growth of Posidonia's prairies. During the thesis presented, a systematic analysis of different communication technologies, such as CAN, Ethernet and PLC, is made for cable communication between the buoy and the sensors inside the water. In addition, technologies such as LoRa, ZigBee and GSM are being studied in order to implement a system that can communicate the buoy with a station on the coast. This work therefore presents a design proposal that uses CAN and GSM / GPRS technologies so that the buoys used in Baseline can communicate the data collected from the seabed of Tossa to a land station.
